|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## User Interface (UI)
The user interface design has been done using Figma to ensure an intuitive and accessible experience. Key components include:

- **Menu**: A centralized view for operators to manage complaints and reports.
- **Claim/Complaint Forms**: Interactive and easy-to-use forms for registering complaints and complaints.
- **Status Tracking**: An interface where citizens can check the status of their claims.
- **Login**: System login.

## User Experience (UX)
The user experience has been designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Key considerations include:

- **Accessibility**: The system is designed to be accessible only by authorized personnel, excluding those with disabilities.
- **Efficient Workflow**: Minimizing the number of steps required to complete key tasks.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Providing immediate responses to user actions to improve interaction and reduce uncertainty.

## Figma Prototyping
A detailed prototype has been created in Figma to visualize and refine the design before implementation. The prototypes include:

- **Low Fidelity Wireframes**: Initial sketches to define the basic structure and navigation flow.
- **High Fidelity Mockups**: Detailed designs that represent the final appearance of the system.
- **prototyping**: Functional simulations that allow testing the user experience.

## Design Considerations
The design detailed in this document ensures that the system is not only functional, but also enjoyable and easy to use for users.

- **Visual Consistency**: Consistent use of colors, typography and styles throughout the entire system.
- **Non-Reactivity**: NON-responsive design to ensure an optimal and unique experience on computers and laptops.
- **Usability**: Focus on ease of use and intuitive navigation to minimize the learning curve.
